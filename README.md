## Functionality
* When the user loads the page, they are shown a chart of employees.
* User can sort employees in descending or ascending order based on any column.
* Using the search bar, user can filter employees to match the user's search input.


## Tasks Completed
* Dowloaded necessary NPM packages with `npm install` on the Command Line
* Created `src` and necessary folders for development
* Using Axios, pulled random users as employees from the https://randomuser.me/ api.
* In the `components` directory:
  * created a `Directory.js` with a React component. 
    * Added necessary `state` variables.
    * created functions to fetch the API data, handle input change, and sort the array.
    * rendered data by passing `state props` and `functions` to other JS files
  * created a `Table.js` to display the employee data
    * all headings (`th`) except for the `picture` heading are clickable to be sorted.
    * in the `tableBody`, the passed in employee list gets mapped into individual employees. Each Employee's name, email, phone number, and address is pulled from the data.
  * created an `EmployeeDB` file to pass the `props` from the `Table.js` tableBody
    * returns data of each employee in the correct coulms to be displayed
* Added necessary scripts to the `package.json` file to deploy on GitHub Pages
